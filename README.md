1. Firstly, I created tickets as if I were an End User(customer). I used the information of the users I created in my previous lab and used this link(http://localhost/osTicket/) to submit the tickets.

2. Next, I logged into osTicket as one of the Agents(workers) I previously created. This agent has System Admin permissions so I opened one of the tickets and made some changes. The ticket was a severe business impacting event so I changed the Priority to Emergency, The Department to System Admin, the SLA Plan to Sev-A, and assigned the ticket to an agent. Lastly, I wrote a reply to update the customer and let them know the ticket is being worked on.

3. Lastly, after the issue was solved, I wrote a reply to the customer letting them know the problem was resolved. I then resloved(closed) the ticket and the ticket was removed and added to the "closed tickets" section.
